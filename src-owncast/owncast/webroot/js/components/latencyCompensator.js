/*
The Owncast Latency Compensator.

It will try to slowly adjust the playback rate to enable the player to get
further into the future, with the goal of being as close to the live edge as
possible, without causing any buffering events.

How does latency occur?
Two pieces are at play. The first being the server. The larger each segment is
that is being generated by Owncast, the larger gap you are going to be from
live when you begin playback.

Second is your media player.
The player tries to play every segment as it comes in.
However, your computer is not always 100% in playing things in real time, and
there are natural stutters in playback. So if one frame is delayed in playback
you may not see it visually, but now you're one frame behind. Eventually this
can compound and you can be many seconds behind.

How to help with this? The Owncast Latency Compensator will:
  - Determine the start (max) and end (min) latency values.
  - Keep an eye on download speed and stop compensating if it drops too low.
  - Limit the playback speedup rate so it doesn't sound weird by jumping speeds.
  - Force a large jump to into the future once compensation begins.
  - Dynamically calculate the speedup rate based on network speed.
  - Pause the compensation if buffering events occur.
  - Completely give up on all compensation if too many buffering events occur.
